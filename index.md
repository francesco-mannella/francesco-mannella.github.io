How do actions, cognition, emotions, and motivations interact to influence the development of mental processes? 
What are the neural mechanisms underlying motor control, and how do they impact cognitive processes? 
What is the role of neuromodulation in learning and modulating cognitive processes?

My main objective is to explore these questions, as well as similar ones, by developing computationally constrained models that are based on neural or behavioral principles. These models are used as controllers for agents to solve tasks in simulated or real environments. 
My research primarily centers around the utilization of artificial neural networks and both physical and simulated robotics.
