How do our minds ground cognition in the diverse and complex stimuli we encounter in our environment? This question lies at the heart of understanding cognitive processes?


 The **Topological Alignment Hypothesis** explains  how action and perceptual representational spaces interact and integrate, allowing us to make sense of our experiences.   

* The cortex contains detailed **topological maps** for understanding what we perceive and how we plan our movements.
* Action maps are **inherently aligned** with perceptual maps, meaning that a location in one map corresponds to a location in the other map.
* Throughout an individual's lifetime, action and perceptual patterns **evolve together** in interaction.
* When these patterns are established, neural activity in a **shared location** signifies a **sensorimotor event**, connecting the action taken by the individual with the resulting perception.
